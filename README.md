# magma_manipulator
This is a magma gateway registration tool. Often we are faced with a situation where some magma pods with gateways are recreated, and we need to re-register them in magma by hand. This is normal when we are dealing with couple gateways, but when we have tens or hundreds of gateways, this operation takes a lot of time. This tool is trying to solve this problem.
